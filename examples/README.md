# Examples

All examples post a single comment on pull requests, which gets updated as more changes are pushed. The examples show how to run the actions with:

* [Terraform directory](terraform-directory): a Terraform project containing HCL code
* [Terraform plan JSON](terraform-plan-json): a Terraform plan JSON file
* [Terragrunt](terragrunt): a Terragrunt project

See the [contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide if you'd like to add an example.
